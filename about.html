    <p id="aboutMe"> My name is Melanie but you can call me Mel for short. I'm 24 years old and currently live in Boston.
      I have some experience when it comes to coding and I'm really looking forward to strengthening my skills
      within the program and getting to know each and one of you better in the course of these next 15 weeks.
      When I'm not learning, I'm usually traveling or spending time with my family and dog. I really love being
      outdoors and spending time at the gym. I also really enjoy watching movies during my free time! </p>

<p id="travel">Whenever I'm not home, I'm typically traveling. I live between Arizona and Boston.
I typically spend my summers back home in Arizona and then my winters here. I love traveling whenever I have
time to. If I'm not traveling then I'm home in boston spending time with my family and my dog. I'm really big on animals and if it was up to me I would have
  like 10 dogs. </p>
