# webpage
This is a small project that I did for the per scholas program. I built a webpage talking a little bit about myself.
My goals for this project is to update it as time goes and clean up the code and make the webpage look more uniformed and have a better layout. 
As of now it looks really good on a laptop but on mobile not so much and ends up reformatting. My goal is to make it look great on mobile as well.
